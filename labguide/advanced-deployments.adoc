## Advanced Application Deployment

Utilizing deployment patterns such as blue/green or canary releases, development
teams can release new versions into production faster while reducing risk.
OpenShift provides capabilities natively in the platform to make it easy to
implement these types of scenarios.

In this lab, you will update your CI/CD pipeline to introduce a new canary stage.
With a canary release, a new version of the application is deployed into production
alongside the old version.  Using advanced traffic routing, a small amount of
production traffic is directed to the new version.  The canary is monitored for
issues, and if all is good, then it is slowly scaled out to server more and more
production traffic until it completely supersedes the old version.  This approach
allows development teams to release changes faster but reduce the risk of deploying
error prone code.

To start the lab, open a new {{ SSH_CONSOLE_URL }}[terminal] and create a curl loop that will
continuously hit your gateway api:

[source, bash]
----
while true; do curl http://gateway-coolstore.{{OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}/hello; done
----

We will use this terminal to view how our canary is slowly rolling out.

### Setting up a Canary Deployment

As discussed in previous labs, an OpenShift *Route* allows you to expose your
services to the outside world.  In addition, a *Route* allows you to route traffic
across multiple services and balance the traffic using weights.  You will create
a new service for the canary and use these weights to control how the traffic
is routed to our canary version.

Start by deploying the new canary service

[source, bash]
----
oc new-app redhat-openjdk18-openshift:1.2~. \
  --context-dir=gateway-vertx \
  --name=gateway-canary -l app=gateway
----

Now that the canary is deployed, you want to update the route to add the canary
service as a backend.  The below command will add the new backend and set the
weight to zero for the canary and 100% for the production backend.  This way no
traffic will hit the canary version yet.

[source, bash]
----
oc set route-backends gateway gateway=100 gateway-canary=0
----

From the OpenShift Web Console, observe that the route for the gateway application
shows the traffic splits:

[NOTE]
====
In the previous lab you should have already disabled build and deploy triggers
on the gateway application.  As a reminder, these triggers were removed with
the following command:

```
oc set triggers dc/gateway --manual
```
====

### Testing the Canary

Next you will make a small code change to the Gateway service and update the
route to start sending traffic to the canary.

Edit `gateway-vertx/src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/gateway/GatewayVerticle.java`
to make a minor change to the *hello* route:

[source, java]
----
...
    @Override
    public void start() {
        Router router = Router.router(vertx);
        router.route().handler(CorsHandler.create("*").allowedMethod(HttpMethod.GET));
        router.get("/health").handler(ctx -> ctx.response().end(new JsonObject().put("status", "UP").toString()));
        // Update the line below
        router.get("/hello").handler(ctx -> ctx.response().end(new JsonObject().put("message", new Timestamp(new Date().getTime()) + " Hello, World! - Update").toString() + "\n"));
        router.get("/api/products").handler(this::products);
...
----

Commit and push your changes.

[source, bash]
----
git commit -am "Updating hello route"
git push
----

Now kickoff a new build of the canary

[source, bash]
----
oc start-build gateway-canary
----

NOTE: You can tail the build log by running `oc logs -f bc/gateway-canary`

Go back to your terminal with the looping curl command and observe that none of
the requests are returning your canary version yet.  This is because we need to
update the route weights.

Update the weights to send 10% of traffic to the canary by running the following
command:

[source,bash]
----
oc set route-backends gateway gateway=90 gateway-canary=10
----

Once again, return to your terminal with the looping curl and you will start to
see responses from your canary version:

Building upon the previous lab, you will now update the Continuous Delivery
pipeline to orchestrate our canary process.

Paste the updated pipeline below into your shell:

[source, bash, copypaste]
