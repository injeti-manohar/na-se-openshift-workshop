## Environment Overview

You will be interacting with an OpenShift 3.11 cluster that is running on {{
ENVIRONMENT }}. The complete environment consists of the following systems:

* 1 master node
* 1 infrastructure node
* 2 "application" nodes

.Lab Environment Overview
[options="header"]
|==============================================
| Role     | Internal FQDN
| Master Node       | {{MASTER_INTERNAL_FQDN}}
| Infrastructure Node        | {{INFRA_INTERNAL_FQDN}}
| Application Node #1        | {{NODE1_INTERNAL_FQDN}}
| Application Node #2        | {{NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN}}
|==============================================

All addresses are internal to the lab environment. The only system you
publicly access via SSH and the browser is the OpenShift Master node:

You will be installing OpenShift Container Platform v3.11 using the advanced
installation method, which involves executing various Ansible playbooks.

Note that references to product documentation will be specifically pointing
to the 3.11 versions, but newer software and documentation versions may be
available.

## Conventions
You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises. Some of
the command blocks can be copy/pasted directly. Others will require modification
of the command before execution. If you see a command block with a red border
(see below), the command will require slight modification.

### Logging in
Most of the exercises in this lab will be facilitated using the OpenShift
command line client. For convenient access you can connect to a web-based SSH
console: {{ SSH_CONSOLE_URL }}

Use the user name assigned to you and the password `{{ KEYNAME }}` when prompted.

After accepting the self-signed certificate, click the `Allow selected permissions`
button to proceed into the terminal.

If you prefer to use an oc client on your system you can do that too, using the
same credentials:

NOTE: Replace userXY below with the user ID that was assigned to you.

[source,bash]
----
oc login https://{{MASTER_EXTERNAL_FQDN}} --username=userXY --password={{KEYNAME}}
